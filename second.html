            <h1>What is Cyber Security</h1>
            <div>
            <p>"Imagine you have a house, and you want to keep it safe from burglars. You'd probably lock your doors, install an alarm system, and maybe even put up some cameras to monitor your property. Cyber security is like that, but for your digital assets.</p>
            </div>
                <div>
                <p>In today's world, we store a lot of important information online: personal data, financial information, trade secrets, and more. And just like with physical assets, we need to protect them from threats.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                <p>Cyber security involves a range of measures to safeguard our digital assets from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. This includes using strong passwords, encrypting sensitive data, keeping software up-to-date, and being cautious about phishing emails or other social engineering tactics.</p>
                </div>    
                <div>
                <p>But just like with physical security, cyber security is not foolproof. There will always be sophisticated criminals who are trying to break into our systems and steal our information. That's why it's important to stay vigilant and be prepared to respond to security incidents.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                <p>Ultimately, cyber security is about protecting what's important to us: our privacy, our identity, and our assets. It's a constant battle against evolving threats, but with the right tools and practices in place, we can stay one step ahead of the bad guys."</p>
